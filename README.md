# Food Scoot



First and foremost (and information a potential investor might want to know): a production/release version of this app is already built, but we elected to go back to the proverbial "drawing board" to construct it with fully memory-safe programming languages. 

Other delivery apps on the market deliver groceries, meals, or other commodities, but not anything and everything. We're going to deliver anything and everything, and do it better. How, you ask? 

We're going to pay delivery drivers well for the incredible service they provide - meaning we'll pay them their state minimum wage for time spent on a delivery *plus* their tips. 

We're going to charge vendors lower commission fees than any other competitors currently at market. 

The margin left is still more than enough to pay a management staff with, and our management staff won't do things like decide to go public, or take 7-figure salaries to go buy yachts and private jets. 

If you're interested in contributing to or sponsoring the project, please reach out to welcome@deliverybutler.net. Thank you!
