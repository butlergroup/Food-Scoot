# Food Scoot :copyright: Project Goals & Info

![logo_small](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0e7c0931-9a79-44ca-b73d-9a384ba8980d)

First and foremost (and information a potential investor, customer, or vendor might want to know): we're production-ready. This app is built with secure and scalable technologies, and its creator is an entrepreneur and a network engineer who knows how to scale it without the need to hire staff. :earth_americas:

Other delivery apps on the market deliver groceries, meals, or other commodities... but not every commodity. We allow any vendor with a valid EIN to register and list their products for sale. If it's sold as a tangible product, we'll deliver it. How do we stand out, you ask? :sparkles:

We pay our delivery drivers their state minimum wage **plus** their tips. We offer vendors lower commission fees than any other competitors currently at market. :tada:

The margin left is still more than enough to pay a management staff with, and our management staff won't do things like decide to go public, or take 7-figure salaries to go buy yachts and private jets. :bowtie:
