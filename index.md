# Vendors (Groceries/Restaurants):

We offer lower commission rates than other delivery apps across the board. Get a 30-day free trial and bring in more business. New vendors will receive a W9 and our standard vendor contract to sign & return upon registration. **Got food that's about to expire? Use Food Scoot to send it to a food bank or homeless shelter instead of a trash can.**

# Literally everyone else:

One of the ways Food Scoot stands out is that we're attempting to address the serious issue of [food waste](https://www.fda.gov/food/consumers/food-loss-and-waste). Vendors will be able to use a special feature in their app dashboard to send food that's about to expire to a local food bank, homeless shelter, etc. instead of throwing it away.
